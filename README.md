This is a simple program written in javascript to identify the type of triangle based on the values that user enters for the 3 triangle sides.

Additional Notes to remember - 

1. Although sample test data is already provided, user can play around and enter different values and get the same results.
2. Only numbers are allowed to be entered in the text fields.
3. All three values must be given before triangle type can be identified by the program.
4. The triangle.html file can be ran using any browser.
